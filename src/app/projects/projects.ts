    description: "Framelight: Guiding composition, before a photo is taken. Today, camera apps have advanced color adjustment features, yet none provide the ability to adjust a photo’s composition. This is because composition is a feature determined when a picture is physically taken. What if there were a way to adjust the composition before a photo is taken? Framelight will analyze a scene and guide the user towards the best composition available in the current scene. This will be done intuitively, with a series of visual instructions such as arrows and lines, and most importantly, on device in real time. Our vision is to give everyone the ability to create, regardless of their photographic ability.",

The system builds on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, Twilio voice integration, and Redis caching to deliver natural, low-latency interactions where users can search for seats, check availability, and book tickets by speaking directly to the agent.\n\nUnlike static retrieval agents, the project enables live database updates, allowing the AI to reserve or release seats in real time while ensuring transactional consistency. A dynamic pricing algorithm adjusts ticket costs based on seat quality and proximity to the concert date, drawing inspiration from revenue models used by platforms like SeatGeek.\n\nIn addition our team focused on ensuring concurrency handling and reliable seat reservations even when multiple users attempt to book simultaneously. The agent’s modular architecture supports scalability, with caching layers to accelerate repeated queries and fallback mechanisms for payment integration or human escalation.",
